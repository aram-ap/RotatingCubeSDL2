# RotatingCubeSDL2
This program displays the wireframe of a rotating cube.

Output is managed by SDL2 graphics library and main functions can be found in the screen.h header file. 

When working on the cube, I used an array of vector points in which I applied the rotation matrix to rotate the cube.
